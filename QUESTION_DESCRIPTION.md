# WebSocket Communication Hub - Question Description

## Overview

Build a comprehensive WebSocket communication hub demonstrating real-time bidirectional communication, connection management, connection pooling, message broadcasting, room-based messaging, connection state tracking, and offline message queuing with SQLite3 persistence. This project teaches modern real-time communication patterns for building chat applications, collaborative tools, and live update systems.

## Project Objectives

1. **WebSocket Connection Management:** Master WebSocket connection lifecycle including connection establishment, tracking, validation, and cleanup with proper resource management.

2. **Real-Time Communication Hub:** Build a central communication hub that routes messages between clients, handles different message types, and manages real-time message delivery.

3. **Connection Pooling:** Implement connection pooling to limit connections per user, manage resources efficiently, and prevent connection exhaustion.

4. **Message Broadcasting:** Learn to broadcast messages to all clients, specific users, or room members with efficient message distribution patterns.

5. **Room-Based Communication:** Implement group messaging with rooms, manage room membership, persist room data in SQLite, and handle room-specific message routing.

6. **Connection State Management:** Track user presence (online/offline/away), persist state in SQLite, implement last-seen tracking, and build presence systems.

7. **Message Queuing for Offline Users:** Store messages for offline users in SQLite, deliver automatically when users reconnect, and manage queue size limits.

## Key Features to Implement

- **WebSocket Management:**
  - Connection tracking with unique IDs
  - Connection lifecycle handling
  - Activity timestamp updates
  - Multi-connection per user support
  - Connection cleanup on disconnect

- **Communication Hub:**
  - Central message routing
  - Direct user messaging
  - Room-based messaging
  - Broadcast messaging
  - Offline message queuing

- **Connection Pooling:**
  - Per-user connection limits
  - Pool size management
  - Connection validation
  - Pool statistics tracking

- **Room System:**
  - Room creation and deletion
  - Join/leave room operations
  - Room member tracking (SQLite)
  - Room message broadcasting
  - Room information retrieval

- **Message Queue:**
  - Offline message storage (SQLite)
  - Automatic delivery on reconnect
  - Queue size limits
  - Message delivery tracking
  - Old message cleanup

- **State Management:**
  - Online/offline/away states
  - State persistence (SQLite)
  - Last seen timestamps
  - Presence queries
  - State change notifications

## Challenges and Learning Points

- **Connection Management:** Handling connection lifecycle, managing disconnections gracefully, cleaning up resources, and tracking multiple connections per user.

- **Message Delivery:** Ensuring message delivery to online users, queuing for offline users, handling delivery failures, and preventing message loss.

- **Scalability:** Managing many concurrent connections, optimizing message routing, handling high message throughput, and scaling WebSocket servers.

- **State Synchronization:** Keeping connection state synchronized, handling reconnections, managing state transitions, and ensuring consistency.

- **Room Management:** Managing room membership, handling concurrent joins/leaves, enforcing room size limits, and persisting room data.

- **Offline Queue:** Deciding queue size limits, implementing message expiration, handling queue overflow, and ensuring reliable delivery.

- **Performance:** Optimizing message routing, minimizing database queries, using indexes effectively, and balancing real-time with persistence.

## Expected Outcome

You will create a functional WebSocket communication hub that demonstrates real-time messaging patterns, connection management, room-based chat, and offline message handling with SQLite persistence. The system will showcase modern real-time communication architecture.

## Comparison with Other Approaches

### WebSocket vs Polling
- **WebSocket:** Real-time, efficient, persistent
- **Polling:** Delayed, inefficient, stateless
- **Use WebSocket for:** Real-time, chat, live updates
- **Use polling for:** Simple updates, compatibility

### In-Memory vs SQLite
- **In-Memory:** Fast, volatile, simple
- **SQLite:** Persistent, reliable, queryable
- **Use in-memory for:** Temporary data, caching
- **Use SQLite for:** Persistence, offline queue, rooms

### Rooms vs Direct Messages
- **Rooms:** Group communication, scalable
- **Direct:** One-to-one, private
- **Use rooms for:** Group chat, broadcasts
- **Use direct for:** Private conversations

## Design Patterns

### Observer Pattern
- Clients observe server events
- Server notifies on changes
- Event-driven communication

### Pub/Sub Pattern
- Publishers send messages
- Subscribers receive messages
- Decoupled communication

### Message Queue Pattern
- Queue for offline users
- Guaranteed delivery
- Asynchronous processing
